## Software Testing, Second Edition. Ron Patton

https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-testing-second/0672327988/pr05.html#fm01lev2sec1

A great deal of science and engineering is behind it, lots of discipline and planning

4 basic areas: 
1. Examining the specification: how to find bugs by inspecting documentation that describes what the software is intended to do.
2. testing the software with blinders on: no access to the code and not knowing how to program
3. examining the code: how to perform detailed analysis of the programs source code to find bugs.
4. 


## Practical TDD linkedin course

Test driven development TDD statred in 2003
part of agile programming
consistently and thoroughly for clean code that works
extreme programing complies with agile manifesto


### Tests drive the code

iterative process

Red: a new test will initially fail
Green: work to get the test to pass
Refactor: optimise test and code

check single identifiable piece of logic/beahviour in a single scenario= unit of functionality in isolation

vs integration test : end to end

## Node.js testing and code quality

existing node.js app
form to request a restaurant reservation

- code is comunication
  computers interpret and execute code
  instructions and rules
- people read and write code
  describes intent

- comunicate intent and everyome has to understand each other

human error and adapt in response

### what is code quality
Joseph M Juran's quality control handbook defines quality: 
1. quality consists of those product features that meet the needs of customers and thereby provide product satisfaction
2. Quality consists of freedom from deficiencies


ie.email storage functionality
store email address- can't store, store non-email

#### quality code: 
1. useful: flexible and reusable
2. maintain: can you mantain the code, can someone else mantain the code, can someone else read and understand the design and intent?
