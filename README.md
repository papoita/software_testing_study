# About

This repo works as a compilation of resources used to prepare for a technical interview related specifically to code testing, quality assurance and design principles.

## Types of Testing

* unit Testing: smallest pieces of code. Write assertions about it

* integration: test bigger pieces of code when they have to work together. (meme of kitchen drawers)

* end-to-end: 

* storybook: visual testing

* static testing: VScode linter

* a/b testing

* Regression testing: testing bugs by causing it the bug to occur

## Tools for testing

Jest - test runner. When creating an app with REACT it comes with Jest
