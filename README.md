# About

This repo works as a compilation of resources used to prepare for a technical interview related specifically to code testing, quality assurance and design principles.

## Types of Testing

* unit Testing: smallest pieces of code (known arguments and get known results). Write assertions about it

* integration: test bigger pieces of code when they have to work together. (meme of kitchen drawers)

* end-to-end: testing the app like the user using the browser by doing it programatically

* storybook: visual testing, showing component rendering

* static testing: VScode linter, underline as typing

* User acceptance testing

* a/b testing

* Regression testing: testing bugs by causing it (the bug) to occur


 ## Fearless refactor

 Thanks to the test suite: you can refactor, modify, optimize and always make sure that code is working the way it should.

 make sure that you have several it's for redundancy and attack edge cases.
 What if we pass in an array of objects, too many things, too few things

testing gives the developer a Lot of power: when creating the test before the function exists:
- define name of function, 
- what arguments and type of it takes
- what files it lives in
- what and types of return values

## Tools for testing

### Unit Testing
* Mocha
* Chai
* Jest - test runner. When creating an app with REACT it comes with Jest

### Integration Testing

Testing Library

# Resources folder 
Has a summary.md file with the links to books, lectures and repo's from a variety of recognized sources of the general subject. 

# Objective

- Preparation for TDD testing with Mocha, Chai, Jest and end to end testing with Cypress. Tech stack: JavaScript and Node.js.

### Good to have

- Understand Techstack: EmberJS, Python(Flask), MySQL.

- Revision of testing concepts in proposed project. Tech stack:  .NET and C#.
