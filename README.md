# About

This repo works as a compilation of resources used to prepare for a technical interview related specifically to code testing, quality assurance and design principles.

## Types of Testing

* unit Testing: smallest pieces of code (known arguments and get known results). Write assertions about it

* integration: test bigger pieces of code when they have to work together. (meme of kitchen drawers)

* end-to-end: testing the app like the user using the browser by doing it programatically

* storybook: visual testing, showing component rendering

* static testing: VScode linter, underline as typing

* User acceptance testing

* a/b testing

* Regression testing: testing bugs by causing it (the bug) to occur

## Tools for testing
 ### Fearless refactor

 Thanks to the test suite: you can refactor, modify, optimize and alwasy make sure that code is working the way it should.

 make sure that you have several it's for redundancy and attack edge cases

* Mocha
* Chai
* Jest - test runner. When creating an app with REACT it comes with Jest


# Resources folder 
Has a summary.md file with the links to books, lectures and repo's from a variety of recognized sources of the general subject. 

# Objective

- Preparation for TDD testing with Mocha, Chai, Jest and end to end testing with Cypress. Tech stack: JavaScript and Node.js.

### Good to have

- Understand Techstack: EmberJS, Python(Flask), MySQL.

- Revision of testing concepts in proposed project. Tech stack:  .NET and C#.
